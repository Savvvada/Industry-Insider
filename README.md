# Industry-Insider

*Objective of this project:*

To provide a working program that allows one to predict the market performance of a song by a particular artist, in addition to the growth of trends in the music industry(such as: genres, bundle sales, and streaming platforms) as a whole. Through the use of this program one can then strategically plan what acts should be allocated "x" amount of funds to match the predicted performance of their record or collection of records (i.e. Albums, Mixtapes, etc). To summarize, while the main focus of this project is to display the application of Data Mining techniques in the entertainment buisness model; one could also consider this project as the Minimum Viable Product created by the consortium of three individuals: Troy White, Justin Sessions, and Savada Wilson.
